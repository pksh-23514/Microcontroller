Description  : Implement a Static Clock on SSD using Internal Timer.
Implement a static (non configurable) clock on SSD (Shown in the video) using internal timer.
1. As soon as the board is powered ON or Reset, the clock should start at 12:00.
2. The decimal point of the hours field (oneâ€™s place) should blink every 500 msecs (0.5 Hz).
3. The clock format should be 24 Hrs.
