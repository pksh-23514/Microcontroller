Description  : Implement dynamic clock on SSD using Internal Timer.
1. As soon as the board is powered on or reset, the clock should start at 00.00.
2. The decimal point of the hours field (oneâ€™s place) should blink every 500 msecs (0.5 Hz).
3. The clock format should be 24Hrs
4. The clock enters into configuration mode by pressing Set / Edit Key.
5. The configuration mode is indicated by a blink on the minute field every 500 msecs
6. The fields can be selected with Choose Field Key, The selected field should blink at the rate of 500 mses indicating the selection
7. The Increment Key could be used to increment and the Decrement Key could be used to decrement the value of selected field, It should be level triggered
8. Once the time is set you may use the Set / Edit Key to start the clock and this mode is called a run mode.
9. No key except Set / Edit key should sensitive in run mode
