Description  : Implement Pattern Generator on LEDs controlled by Switches.
1. There are 8 LEDs on the Board, these LEDs has to glow one by one as if a train bogie coming out of a tunnel every second from Left to Right as soon as the board is powered on or reset.
2. Once all LEDS are ON, the LEDs  should switch OFF one by one as if the train bogie is entering inside a tunnel from Left to Right (Letâ€™s call it as entry).
3. The direction of train would remain as is unless and until the DCI (Direction Change Input) is detected.
4. On Direction Change Input, The Train direction should change instantly to opposite and remains same until the next Direction Change Input.
